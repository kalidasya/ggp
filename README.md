Go genetic programming based on [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap/) which is an awesome framework. This project by far not aiming to implement DEAP in go, but is mostly an exercise for me to learn go. It is only focusing on the genetic algorithm part and nothing else. If you are interested there is another DEAP reimplementation (also not complete) which aims other part of the original framework: [DEAG](https://github.com/sineatos/deag/)
